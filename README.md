# Explainability-of-deep-learning-model-using-LIME


**Aim** : Implementation of LIME for explainability of deep learning model

**Dataset** : CIFAR10

This work includes the ImageNet Pretrained Model and generation a visual explanation of the model's predictions on
10 samples from CIFAR-10 test data using LIME. (One sample from each class)
